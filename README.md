My website

This repository will be for working on my website.  I think I want the workflow to be something along the lines of:
<ol>
    <li>Working locally (Hmm, on my home machine or the server?), writing code and testing locally (Will I need an apache server to test the code?).  Eventually write a commit.</li>
    <li>Push the commits to the github Repository</li>
    <li>Pull the commits from the guthub Repo into the server's directory root</li>
    <li>Restart the apache server</li>
</ol>
