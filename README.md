#mySite
This repository will be for working on my website.  I think I want the workflow to be something along the lines of:
1. Working locally (Hmm, on my home machine or the server?), writing code and testing locally (Will I need an apache server to test the code?).  Eventually write a commit.
2. Push the commits to the github Repository
3. Pull the commits from the guthub Repo into the server's directory root
4. Restart the apache server
